## Description

This repo contains a pet Scala project. The goal is to model the potential backend of an API for an app to help personal trainers (potentially any other service providers) keep track of their clients.

For example, personal trainers would need the following information on each client:
1. exercise logs/records - what I did with the client on a given day or what the client did on their own
2. exercise prescription - what the client should do
3. diet records
4. exercise photos/videos or progress pics/videos
5. notes
6. chat/mail system
7. calendar/appointment system
8. payment/billing system

## Technologies

The backend is written in Scala. The goal is to use the Play framework to implement an API and work on a front end in React, probably working towards a PWA.
